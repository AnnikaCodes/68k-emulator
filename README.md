# 68k-emulator
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/AnnikaCodes/68k-emulator/branch/main/graph/badge.svg?token=34F58OM0YJ)](https://codecov.io/gh/AnnikaCodes/68k-emulator)

WIP emulator of 680x0 processors. I'm creating this solely to learn; please don't expect it to work.

- `emulator/` is a library that ostensibly emulates a Motorola 68000 series processor (possibly extended in the future to specific Macintosh model(s))
- `run68/` runs compiled 68k code
- `website/` is a website for the project; the use of Ace.js to support a REPL is based on the [Kuroko REPL](https://github.com/kuroko-lang/kuroko-wasm-repl)
