# 68k-emulator
WIP emulator of 680x0 processors. I'm creating this solely to learn; please don't expect it to work.

- `emulator/` is a library that ostensibly emulates a Motorola 68000 series processor (possibly extended in the future to specific Macintosh model(s))
- `repl/` is supposed to be a REPL (prints the CPU state) for 68k assembly
